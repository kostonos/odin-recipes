    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground dried rosemary</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rubbed dried sage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (15 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
        <li>1 medium orange, cut into 8 wedges</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped into large pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
        <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle champagne</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roaster with sheets of aluminum foil long enough to wrap around turkey.</li>
        <li>Stir parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon-pepper seasoning, and salt together in a small bowl. </li>
        <li>Rub herb mixture into turkey cavity, then stuff with orange wedges, onion, carrot, and celery. Tie turkey legs together with kitchen string, then tuck the wings under the body. </li>
        <li>Place turkey on the foil in the roasting pan. Pour champagne and chicken broth over turkey, making sure to get some liquid in the cavity. </li>
        <li> Bring aluminum foil up and over the top of turkey and seal; try to keep the foil from touching the turkey. </li>
        <li>Roast turkey in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 2 ½ to 3 hours. Uncover turkey and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown, 30 to 60 more minutes.
             An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Remove turkey from the oven, cover with two sheets of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
